## Usage

### Bingo lists and generators

Use the `getBingoList()` function to retrieve the bingo list of a specific bingo version:

```ts
import { getBingoList } from "oot-bingo-lists";

const bingoList = getBingoList("v10.2");
```

Note that the latest version of the [oot-bingo-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oot-bingo-generator) might not
match with the generator that was used for a specific bingo version.
Get a version specific generator with `getGenerator()`:

```ts
import { getGenerator } from "oot-bingo-lists";

const generator = getGenerator("v10.2");
```

#### Latest version

Get the bingo list of the latest version:

```ts
import { getBingoList, latestBingoVersion } from "oot-bingo-lists";

const bingoList = getBingoList(latestBingoVersion);
```

### Generate boards

It's also possible to generate boards. The package will use the generator that actually belonged to your
specified version, so that the resulting boards are correct:

```ts
import { generateBingoBoardFromVersion } from "oot-bingo-lists";

const board = generateBingoBoardFromVersion("v9.3", "blackout", 654321);
```
